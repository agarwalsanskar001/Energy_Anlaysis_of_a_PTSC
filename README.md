Heat Tranfer Analysis for the solar, optical, and the thermal model of a Parabolic Trough Solar Collector.

- Analyzed the solar, optical, and thermal models of LS3 specification PTSC. Conducted its heat transfer analysis in MATLAB.
- Identified the Glass envelope inner & outer temperature and absorber surface inner and outer temperature for given inlet conditions.
- Reviewed the trends in the temperatures of various components of PTSC w.r.t. the inlet and the solar conditions.
